# Project: Data Pipeline with Airflow
## Project Overview
Sparkify, a music streaming company, wants to enhance their data warehouse ETL pipelines with automation and monitoring using Apache Airflow. The goal is to create dynamic, reusable, and easily monitored data pipelines that can handle backfills and ensure data quality through post-ETL tests. The data originates from S3 and needs to be processed in Amazon Redshift. The datasets are JSON logs of user activity and song metadata.

## Project Requirements
Apache Airflow Setup: Create and configure an Airflow environment.
Custom Operators: Implement four custom operators to:
   Stage data from S3 to Redshift.
   Load data into Redshift tables.
   Run SQL transformations.
   Perform data quality checks.
Data Pipeline: Develop a coherent data flow within the pipeline using the provided template and helper class.
Monitoring and Backfills: Ensure the pipeline supports monitoring and allows easy backfilling of data.


## Key Tasks

Staging Data:
Extract JSON logs and metadata from S3.
Load data into staging tables in Redshift.

Loading Data Warehouse:
Implement tasks to load data from staging tables to fact and dimension tables in Redshift.

Transformations:
Execute provided SQL transformations to process the data.

Data Quality Checks:
Define and implement data quality checks to verify data integrity post-ETL.
